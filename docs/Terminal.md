# Terminal :computer:

Terminal service provides an interface to run terminal commands
for terminal-enabled uAPI credentials.

You can use Terminal service to run commands on behalf of your own PCC
or to use `emulatePcc` option from `auth` to run commands on behalf of other PCC
using your own Service bureau.
